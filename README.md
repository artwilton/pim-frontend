# PIM - The Person Inventory Manager

**PIM** is a React Native application developed as my final project for Flatiron School. It allows users to create an inventory of items, keep track of where they put those items, and add metadata to the items and their containers.

Here's a demo of PIM from the Flatiron School Science Fair:
